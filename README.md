# Invoices app
This is test task for ReactJS developer  

## Getting started
- clone this repo
- install dependencies and start server with next command  
`npm install && npm start`
- open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Deliverables
- Use standard Bootstrap components for the UI
- Place all assets inside the /public directory. Do not create a separate application to serve your assets.
- API.md has declaration of all available routes
- The default page should be a list of existing invoices. This page should have a button for creating a new invoice.
- The invoice form should support selecting an existing Customer
- The invoice form should make it easy to browse and add existing Products (you should be able to add any number of products)
- When a Product is added there should be a way to edit the quantity
- There should be a place to enter a discount for the invoice (a percentage discount)
- At the bottom of the page you should show a dynamically calculated invoice total. This total should take into account the quantity and price of each product and the invoice discount
- As changes are made on the invoice form they should be automatically saved through the API (don't require use of a Save button)
